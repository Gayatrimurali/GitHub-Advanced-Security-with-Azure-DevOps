### Remove Branch Policy

This task is being carried out to facilitate a seamless workflow during testing in the lab environment. However, please note that in a production environment, it is recommended to enable this policy as a best practice as its always good to link you PR to the work items that is created for any specific items.

1. Navigate to the **eShopOnWeb** project and select **Repos** from the left menu.

      ![allow-permissions](media/pg3-12.png)

1. Navigate to **Branches** menu and select **Branch Policies** for the Main branch.

      ![allow-permissions](media/pg3-13.png)

1. Turn **Off** the **Check for linked work items** policy.

      ![allow-permissions](media/pg3-14.png)

This action will remove the requirement for linking work items when working with branches in the lab environment.

### Create Azure DevOps - Personal Access Token 

In this task, you will create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Azure DevOps and integrate it into our codebase. This integration is essential for testing advanced security functionalities later in the lab and to demonstrate how the advance security functionality works and detect any security threat.

1. Click on **User settings (1)** and select **Personal access tokens (2)**.

   ![allow-permissions](media/v1.png)

1. Select **+ New Token**.

   ![](media/updatedghasimg4.png)

1. On **Create a new personal access token** window, enter the below values and click on **Create (4)**.

    | Setting | Value |
    |----------|-------|
    | Name | **AzDo_PAT (1)** |
    | Scopes | **Custom defined (2)** |
    | Work Items | **Read & write (3)** |

    ![allow-permissions](media/06-26-2024(9).png)

1. Once you've generated the token, click on the **Copy** icon to the right of the secret value in the notepad. Once copied, click on **Close**.

   ![allow-permissions](media/06-26-2024(1).png)

1. Click on the **Azure DevOps (1)** logo from the top left, click on **eShopOnWeb (2)** project.

   ![allow-permissions](media/gidev1.png)

1. Navigate to **eShopOnWeb** project > **Repos** > **src** > **Web** > and select **Constants.cs** file and click on **Edit**.

   ![allow-permissions](media/editv1.png)

  > **Note**: Ensure to add the **SemiColon (;)** after adding the token.

1. Add **public const string AZ_PAT = "Your-Secret-Value";** to the existing code as shown below. Replace "Your-Secret-Value" with your PAT token, and **commit** the changes.

   ![allow-permissions](media/addcv.png)

1. On the **Commit** page, provide the branch name as **addsecret (1)** and click on **Commit (2)**.

   ![allow-permissions](media/addsecrets.png)

  >**Note**: You were able to add the secret value directly to the code without any issues, which emphasizes that the advanced security feature is not yet enabled. We will be enabling it in the next step and you will be able to see the advance security feature in action. 

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide. 
> - If you need any assistance, please contact us at **cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com**. We are available 24/7 to help you out.

Afterward, re-run the pipeline on the main branch and wait until it completes successfully. Use this process for any similar errors you encounter in upcoming labs.

1. You can also see how each task is categorized in pipeline run and you can expant to see the actual raw results. 

## Task 3: Understand and Manage Advanced Security Permissions

In this task, you'll learn about the advanced security permissions available for the eShopOnWeb repository in Azure DevOps. While Project Administrators typically have the necessary permissions to manage security settings, understanding these permissions is important for scenarios where adjustments might be necessary.

### Overview of Advanced Security Permissions

Azure DevOps provides advanced security features that allow you to manage and monitor the security of your repository. Here are the key permissions:

1. **Manage and dismiss alerts:** This permission allows users to handle security alerts generated by advanced security tools. Typically, this is used by security teams to address potential vulnerabilities or issues flagged in the codebase.

2. **Manage settings:** This permission enables users to configure and adjust security settings for the repository. While Project Administrators generally have this permission by default, there might be scenarios where it is delegated to specific security-focused roles.

3. **View alerts:** This permission allows users to view security alerts without the ability to manage them. This might be useful for auditors or other roles that need to monitor security without making changes.

### When to Adjust Permissions

While Project Administrators generally do not need to adjust their own permissions, there are scenarios where it might be necessary to modify these settings:

- **Delegation to Security Teams:** In larger organizations, security teams might be assigned specific roles within a project. In such cases, you might adjust permissions to give these teams control over managing and dismissing alerts without full administrative rights.
  
- **Auditing and Compliance:** If your organization requires strict auditing or compliance controls, you might grant specific users or groups the ability to view alerts without granting them the power to manage settings or dismiss alerts.

### How to Access, Review, and Set Security Settings

1. Click **Project settings (1)** in the lower-left corner. In the left menu under Repos, click **Repositories (2)**, then select the **eShopOnWeb (3)** repository.

      ![setup](media/06-26-2024(4).png)

1. Select **Security (1)** and click on **Project Administrators (2)**.

1. Next to Advanced Security: manage and dismiss alerts, click the **dropdown**, and select  **Allow**.

1. Next to Advanced Security: manage settings, click the **dropdown**, and select **Allow**.

1. Next to Advanced Security: view alerts, click the dropdown, and select **Allow**.

      ![allow-permissions](media/06-26-2024(6).png)

1. Make sure a green checkmark ✅ appears next to the selected permission.

For detailed guidance on configuring these settings, refer to the following documentation:
